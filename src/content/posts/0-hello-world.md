hello world!


this is a very minimal website i made to host my thoughts. it's not much but it's fully mine, a place to freely write whatever crosses my mind without being constrained by the terrible layout of instagram stories or the shortcomings of whatever other platform the tech lords give us. 

most importantly, this website **collects no data from you whatsoever** and should also prevent crawling bots from using its contents to train AI models.

to be fair, i’m also very happy with the cool domain i found! hope you'll enjoy the schizo posts!

:)
