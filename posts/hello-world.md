hello world!

<br />

this is a little very minimal website i made to host my thoughts and shit. it's not much but it's fully mine. nothing inherently interesting or particularly deep, just a place to freely write whatever passes on my mind without being contstrained by the terrible layout of instagram stories or whatever other platform the tech lords give us. most importantly **without any data collection or AI training.**

<br />

to be fair i started this because i found a cool domain lol. hope you'll enjoy the schizo posts!

<br />

:)
