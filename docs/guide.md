# How to Write Notes

This blog now uses **Tailwind Typography** to automatically style your posts. This means you can focus on writing and let the code handle the design.

## Basic Writing

**Paragraphs**: You no longer need to use `<br />`. Just press **Enter twice** to create a new paragraph. The website will automatically add the perfect amount of space between them.

```markdown
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph. It will have nice spacing above it automatically.
```

**Bold & Italic**: Use `**text**` for bold and `*text*` for italic.

## Advanced Features (Now Supported)

**Headings**: Use `#` for headings.
```markdown
## My Section Title
```

**Lists**: Use `-` for bullet points.
```markdown
- First item
- Second item
```

**Quotes**: Use `>` for blockquotes.
```markdown
> This is a quote.
```

## Images

We have upgraded the image system. You can now use standard markdown images, and they will automatically be optimized for speed and layout stability.

```markdown
![Description of image](/path/to/image.jpg)
```

**Note**: Make sure your images are in the `public` folder. If you have an image at `public/my-dog.jpg`, you should link it as `/my-dog.jpg`.
